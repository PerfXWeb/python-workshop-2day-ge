# Python Crash Course

Python Crash Course - From absolute 0 to Python hero

Workshop by Matthias Hausberger. Presented by SMARTUP / WTO.

# Content of this Gitlab repository
## Cheat Sheets
This is all this Python Workshop is about. Easy explanations, exercises, tips and more. One of the files includes ALL SOLUTIONS to the exercises (which is what is presented), the other one does NOT include them so you can try all exercises for yourself!

- In case you want to (or you're prompted to) open these notebooks in Google Colab:
 - [Link to open the notebook WITHOUT solutions in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerfXWeb/python-workshop-2day-ge/blob/master/Python_CheatSheet_noSolutions.ipynb)
 - [Link to open the notebook WITH solutions in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerfXWeb/python-workshop-2day-ge/blob/master/Python_CheatSheet_withSolutions.ipynb)

## Python Workshop Slides
You can download the workshop slides and open them locally on your computer as a html file. These consist of exactly what is in the Cheat Sheet so no need to really look at them unless you prefer the slide design.

## sample_code
Just some sample code that we discussed in class, as well as everything that is discussed in the live coding sessions. If you want me to add some more here or if you have code that you want to share with your colleagues, let me know via matthias@perfxweb.com, I will upload it here.

## images folder
Just all memes and images used in the Colab Notebook.



Don't worry about the .gitignore and README.md files too much.
